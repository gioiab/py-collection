The py-collection project
=========================

The project aims to be a collection of Pythonic challenges and exercises. The "challenges" package 
collects solutions to structured problems, some of them come from past interviews. The "hackerrank" 
package collects solutions to the problems provided on https://www.hackerrank.com. Hackerrank provides 
challenges with a varying difficulty: some of them are easy and some are not. All the code in the 
"hackerrank" package has been commented with docstrings following the reStructuredText format.
